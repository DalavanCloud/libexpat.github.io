Expat is a stream-oriented parser in which an application registers handlers
for things the parser might find in the XML document (like start tags).

An [introductory article](https://www.xml.com/pub/1999/09/expat/index.html)
on using Expat is available on
[xml.com](https://www.xml.com/pub/1999/09/expat/index.html).

There are also two examples coming with Expat
(but they provide little background):

* [`elements.c`](https://github.com/libexpat/libexpat/blob/master/expat/examples/elements.c)
* [`outline.c`](https://github.com/libexpat/libexpat/blob/master/expat/examples/outline.c)
