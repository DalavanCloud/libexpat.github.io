If you know of any additional articles or resources which should be linked to
from this page, please
[open a bug](https://github.com/libexpat/libexpat.github.io/issues)
for this website or
[provide a pull request](https://github.com/libexpat/libexpat.github.io/pulls).
We're especially interested in links to tutorial information and open source
interfaces to Expat from languages other than C.

  * [James Clark's original Expat page](http://www.jclark.com/xml/expat.html), for Expat 1.2 and earlier
  * [Introductory article](http://www.xml.com/pub/1999/09/expat/index.html) on using Expat on [xml.com](http://www.xml.com/)
  * [LuaExpat](http://www.keplerproject.org/luaexpat/) is a wrapper around Expat for the [Lua](http://www.lua.org/) programming language. The [LuaSOAP](http://www.keplerproject.org/luasoap/) library is a [SOAP](http://xml.coverpages.org/soap.html) implementation built on top of [LuaExpat](http://www.keplerproject.org/luaexpat/).
  * Perl's `XML::Parser` module is a wrapper built around a binding to Expat in the `XML::Parser::Expat` module.
  * [Documentation for the Python interface to Expat](http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-xml.parsers.expat.html), part of the standard documentation for Python.
  * [SAXExpat.NET](http://saxdotnet.sourceforge.net/saxexpat.html), a [.NET](http://www.microsoft.com/net/) wrapper for Expat, conforming to the [SAX for .NET](http://saxdotnet.sourceforge.net) specifications.
  * The [Simple C Expat Wrapper](http://www.nongnu.org/scew/) is a wrapper around Expat that provides a light-weight object model somewhat like a DOM.
  * _[C++ Wrappers for the Expat XML Parser](http://www.codeproject.com/soap/expatimpl.asp "C++ Wrappers for the Expat XML Parser" )_, an article by Tim Smith providing object-oriented wrappers for Expat. The wrappers use some MFC-biased naming, but look interesting.
  * [Arabica](http://www.jezuk.co.uk/cgi-bin/view/arabica "Arabica" ) \-- an XML Parser toolkit for C++ programmers, with SAX2 implementations based on several parsers, including Expat.
  * [ExpatMM -- C++ interface to Expat](http://devzone.intellitree.com/projects/expatmm/)
  * [SAX2 Wrapper for using Expat in Delphi,](http://sourceforge.net/projects/kdsxml) based on ["SAX for Pascal"](http://saxforpascal.sourceforge.net) interface specs
  * The [TclXML project](http://tclxml.sourceforge.net/) includes a [Tcl](http://tcl.activestate.com/) binding for Expat
  * [tDOM](http://www.tdom.org/) is an alternate package providing XML support for [Tcl](http://tcl.activestate.com/), based in part on Expat.
  * [Article on using Expat from PHP](http://www.phpbuilder.com/columns/justin20000428.php3) on [&lt;?PHPBuilder?&gt;](http://www.phpbuilder.com/)   
(broken into lots of tiny pieces)

  * [Objective-C interface to Expat](http://expatobjc.sourceforge.net/)
  * [OCaml Expat](http://www.xs4all.nl/~mmzeeman/ocaml/) is a wrapper around Expat for the [Objective Caml](http://www.ocaml.org) language.
  * [Ruby interface to Expat](http://www.yoshidam.net/Ruby.html#xmlparser)
  * [XML Tools 2](http://www.latenightsw.com/freeware/XMLTools2/) is an AppleScript scripting addition that allows AppleScript applications to work with XML data; it is based on Expat.
  * [Simkin](http://www.simkin.co.uk/) is an open source scripting language available under the GNU LGPL. It can be embedded in XML and supports a DOM-like API backed by Expat.
  * [EasySoap](http://easysoap.sourceforge.net/) is a C++ SOAP implementation which uses Expat.
  * [A discussion](http://www.codepedia.com/wiki/display.aspx?WikiID=1&pagename=thunks) of another way to manage stateful callbacks, using Expat as a sample library.
  * The [GOBO project](http://sourceforge.net/projects/gobo-eiffel/) is working on an Eiffel binding for Expat. Development is active and the package is fully supported in GOBO 3.0 and 3.1, though there isn't much status information about the Expat bindings on the website. (Most activity is reportedly on the relevant mailing lists.)
  * [Expat4D](http://www.mitchenall.com/expat4d) is a plug-in for the [4th Dimension](http://www.4duk.com/) application framework.
