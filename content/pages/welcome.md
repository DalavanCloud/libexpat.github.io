Welcome to Expat, a stream-oriented XML parser library written in C.<br/>
Expat excels

 * with files that do not fit RAM, and
 * where performance and flexibility are crucial.

If you would rather use a DOM parser, you may want to
check out [libxml2](http://xmlsoft.org/).

Please continue reading with:

 * [Getting Started](doc/getting-started/)
 * [XML Security](doc/xml-security/)
 * [Common Pitfalls](doc/common-pitfalls/)

If you have found a bug,
please [report it](https://github.com/libexpat/libexpat/issues) so it gets fixed.
Thank you!

The Expat development team
