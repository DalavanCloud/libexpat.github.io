Welcome to Expat, a stream-oriented XML parser library written in C.

Please note, **this website is work-in-progress**.
For now, [www.libexpat.org](http://www.libexpat.org/) may be of more help.
Be encouraged to join the transition with
[your own pull requests](https://github.com/libexpat/libexpat.github.io/pulls).

Expat excels

 * with files that do not fit RAM, and
 * where performance and flexibility are crucial.

If you would rather use a DOM parser, you may want to
check out [libxml2](http://xmlsoft.org/).

Please continue reading with:

 * [Getting Started](pages/getting-started.html)
 * [XML Security](pages/xml-security.html)
 * [Common Pitfalls](pages/common-pitfalls.html)

If you have found a bug,
please [report it](https://github.com/libexpat/libexpat/issues) so it gets fixed.
Thank you!

The Expat development team
